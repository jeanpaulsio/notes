# Chapter 4 - TDD Rails

Tests should be "SWIFT"

1. Straightforward
2. Well defined
3. Independent
4. Fast
5. Truthful

## Straightforward

A test is straightforward if its purpose is immediatebly understandable. every test should have a point

## Well Defined

A test is well-defined if running the same tests repeatedly gives the same results


## Independent

A test is independent if it does not depend on any other tests or external data to run. an independent test suite gives the same results no matter the order in which the tests are run

A test suite passing shouldn't be dependent on if it runs in a particular order

## Fast

The ability to go back and forth between running tests and writing code without breaking focus is crucial to being able to use TDD as a design tool

## Truthful

A truthful test accurately reflects the underlying code. it passes when the underlying code works, and fails when it does not. easier said than done, obviously
