# Traction
* The common startup projectory goes something like this:
* Founders have an idea for a company they're excited about.
* Initial excitement turns into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door.
* The founders expect customers to come racing to their door
* Customers don't care
* Traction is an afterthought.
* They run out of money and their company dies

# Chapter 1 - Traction Channels

> Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand
> - Naval Ravikant, Angel List founder

* Traction is growth. Pursuit of traction is what defines a startup

# Chapter 2 - Traction Thinking

* What do all failed startups have in common? **ans: not enough customers**
* Traction and Product development should get equal attention
* Four common situations:
  - 1. you build something people want but can't figure out a viable business model
  - 2. you build something people want but there aren't enough customers to reach profitability
  - 3. you build something people want but reaching customers is expensive
  - 4. you build something people want but a lot of other companies have built it too
* It's important to work on product development and traction equally when you are starting out
* Parallel product + traction development lets you test different traction channels simultaneously

__Moving the needle__

* It's important to define what traction means for your company
* you need to set a traction goal
* __figure out what traction means in hard numbers__

> startups take off because the founders make them take off ... The most commmon unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all start-ups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out there and get them

__Three Phases__
1. making something people wants
2. marketing something people want
3. scaling your business

# Chapter 3 - Bullseye

### Outer Ring: What's Possible
* It is important to brainstorm every traction channel
* imagine what success looks like in each of the 19 channels
* Each channel should have at least one decent strategy for moving the needle
* look at how similar companies acquired customers over time and how unsuccessful companies wasted their money

### Middle Ring: What's Probable
* Run cheap traction tests in the channels that seem the most promising
* your middle ring should have multiple traction channels and you can run multiple tests at the same time
* for each channel in your middle ring, construct a cheap traction test that will answer the following three questions:
  - 1. how much will it cost to acquire new customers?
  - 2. how many customers are available through this channel?
  - 3. are the kind of customers we get through this channel the kind of customers we want right now?

### Inner Ring: What's Working
* focus SOLELY on the channel that will move the needle the most
* your middle ring should produce promising results
* all resources and efforts should go towards your core channel
* don't be distracted by the other channels that produce - but don't produce as much as your core channel

# Chapter 4 - Traction Testing

__how do you approach testing?__

* channel strategies are particular ways to acquire customers within a channel
* remember that you should be running *several* cheap tests that don't take too much effort
* for example you could run two social ads and two landing pages that give an indication as to how succesful a given strategy is

### Inner Ring Tests
* Once you determine your inner ring channel, you should continuously test in order to increase its effectiveness
* Over time, all marketing channels become saturated. this means that what USED to be effective, probably isn't anymore
  - for example, when banner ads first came out, they used to get a lot of clicks. nowadays, they don't
* Thus, it's important to find untapped channel strategies - which might mean trying someting different in an established venue. maybe its a venue that no one else is using. You have to jump on the opportunity because these untapped venues will eventually become saturated too

__A note on A/B Testing__

* A/B testing is a scientific experiment with a control group (A) and an experimental group (B)
* The purpose of this kind of testing is to measure the effectiveness of a change in one or more variables (perhaps different font colors, flyer verbiage, etc)
* You create one version of your page for the control group, a second version for the experimental
* By tracking how each page performs, you can find out whether your changes are having a key impact
* Then apply the change and reap the benefits
* A/B testing should be done frequently to help optimize your channel

### Online Tools
* **each test needs a point**: to validate or invalidate specific assumptions you specify ahead of time
* good questions to ask

1. how many prospective customers landed on my website?
2. what are the demographics of my best and worst customers?
3. are customers who interact with my support team more likely to stay customers longer?

* Some basic analytics tools:
  - Clicky
  - Mixpanel
  - Chartbeat
* create a spreadsheet to rank and prioritize traction channels. you should have columns that include:
  - number of available customers
  - conversion rate
  - cost to acquire customer
  - lifetime value of customer
* **does this channel have enough customers to be valuable?**

# Chapter 5 - Critical Path
* How do you decide what to work on?
* It's **important** to define a traction goal. Are you going for *growth* or are you going for *profitablity*
* Define a traction goal explicitlyz: i.e. "obtain x amount of signups in a month"
* **lay out milestones**: set out specific milestones and figure out the *fewest number of steps* it takes to reach your end goal
* Remember, it's important not to be biased for or against traction channels

> It can be a competitive advantage (or at least a temporary one) if you can acquire customers in channels that others cannot, or refuse to try.

# Chapter 6 - Targeting Blogs

__how Mint did it__

Former head of marketing at Mint, Noah Kagan sent emails to bloggers with the subject, "Can I send you 500 dollars?" The thing is, personal bloggers have strong readerships but dont make money from their writing. This was a great way to inject their product into specific blogs where Noah knew that he would be targeting the right people.

__taregeting blog tactics__

* __search engines__ - search for things like "top blogs for x" or "best x blogs"
* __youtube__ - search for your product keywords on youtube and you'll get the most popular videos in your industry. these youtubers might have blogs and it can be beneficial to establish a relationship with these people
* __Delicious__ - Delicious allows you to use keywords to find links that others have saved
* __Twitter__ - you can use tools like *Followerwonk* and *Klout* to determine top twitter accounts
* __Social mentions__ - this site helps you determine sites that have the most frequent mentions for your keywords
* __talk to people__ - you can ask people directly the kinds of content that they read online. then you can go ahead and target those kinds of sites

Link sharing communities can also help you. Think reddit, Hackernews, Product Hunt, etc.

## Summary
* run tests on a variety of small blogs
* sponsor small blogs, especially personal blogs
* offer something unique and exclusive to your best targets on these blogs

# Chapter 7 - Publicity
* traditional media news outlets
* starting small can lead to big publicity:
  - an article today in *TechCrunch* can lead to a feature in *The New York Times*

__How do you get press?__

*ans: understand internet-driven media*

* understand that when a big media outlet writes about you, they are doing YOU a favor because there is only a fininite number of stories that they put out. On the flips ide, when a blog writes about you, you are doing THEM a favor because there is no limit to how much content they can push. these smaller blogs are trying to get as many views as they can because they're driven by ads
* Find blogs that TechCrunch reads and target those blogs. then slowly climb the ladder
  - by doing this, you no longer have to pitch to the bigger names like CNN and NBC directly

__How do you get a reporters attention?__

* milestones: raising money, launching a new product, breaking a usage barrier, a PR stunt, a big partnership, or a special industry report

__Publicity Tactics__
* contact reporters only when you have newsworthy milestones to share
* okay so you have a solid story and want some news reporters to get their eyeballs on it. now what?
* __draw as much attention to it as possible__
  - submit the story to link-sharing sites like reddit and hackernews
  - share it on social media and amplify with social ads
  - email it to influencers in your industry for comment. some of these people will share it too
  - ping blogs in your space and tell them that you have a story that's getting some buzz

# Chapter 8 - Unconventional PR
* PR stunts can generate press coverage and buzz
  - a PR stunt = anything engineered to get media coverage
  - you create a spectacle and get people to notice
* Unconventional PR doesn't suffer from crowding that other popular traction channels face
* __Be prepared for failure, not every idea will work__

__Publicity Stunts__

* an example that we can point to is the YouTube series that BlendTec created: *Will it blend?* - blending things like iPhones for PR coverage
* the key is to be **creative**. do something **cheap**, **fun**, and **original**

__Customer Appreciation__

* do awesome things for your customers and good things will follow
* the hope is that by doing awesome things for your customers, you'll get some publicity
  - if you get no publicity, youll still get happy customers which might lead to some word-of-mouth mentions
* doing something awesome for your customers doesn't have to be expensive, it can be hand written letters or homemade cookies, anything!

> Good customer support is so rare that, if you simply try to make your customers happy, they are likely to spread the news of your awesome product on that basis alone

__case studies__

* Dollar Shave Club acquired more than 12k customers with a short video that cost 5k dollars
* Blendtec increased their sales by 500% after starting the youtube series, "Will it blend"
