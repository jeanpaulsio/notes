# Traction
* The common startup projectory goes something like this:
* Founders have an idea for a company they're excited about.
* Initial excitement turns into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door.
* The founders expect customers to come racing to their door
* Customers don't care
* Traction is an afterthought.
* They run out of money and their company dies

# Chapter 1 - Traction Channels

> Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand

# Chapter 2 - Traction Thinking

* What do all failed startups have in common? **ans: not enough customers**
* Traction and Product development should get equal attention
* Four common situations:
  - 1. you build something people want but can't figure out a viable business model
  - 2. you build something people want but there aren't enough customers to reach profitability
  - 3. you build something people want but reaching customers is expensive
  - 4. you build something people want but a lot of other companies have built it too
* It's important to work on product development and traction equally when you are starting out
* Parallel product + traction development lets you test different traction channels simultaneously

__Moving the needle__

* It's important to define what traction means for your company
* you need to set a traction goal
* __figure out what traction means in hard numbers__

> startups take off because the founders make them take off ... The most commmon unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all start-ups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out there and get them

# Chapter 3 - Bullseye

### Outer Ring: What's Possible
* It is important to brainstorm every traction channel
* imagine what success looks like in each of the 19 channels
* Each channel should have at least one decent strategy for moving the needle
* look at how similar companies acquired customers over time and how unsuccessful companies wasted their money

### Middle Ring: What's Probable
* Run cheap traction tests in the channels that seem the most promising
* your middle ring should have multiple traction channels and you can run multiple tests at the same time
* for each channel in your middle ring, construct a cheap traction test that will answer the following three questions:
  - 1. how much will it cost to acquire new customers?
  - 2. how many customers are available through this channel?
  - 3. are the kind of customers we get through this channel the kind of customers we want right now?

### Inner Ring: What's Working
* focus SOLELY on the channel that will move the needle the most
* your middle ring should produce promising results
* all resources and efforts should go towards your core channel
* don't be distracted by the other channels that produce - but don't produce as much as your core channel

# Chapter 4 - Traction Testing

__how do you approach testing?__

* channel strategies are particular ways to acquire customers within a channel
* remember that you should be running *several* cheap tests that don't take too much effort
* for example you could run two social ads and two landing pages that give an indication as to how succesful a given strategy is

### Inner Ring Tests
* Once you determine your inner ring channel, you should continuously test in order to increase its effectiveness
* Over time, all marketing channels become saturated. this means that what USED to be effective, probably isn't anymore
  - for example, when banner ads first came out, they used to get a lot of clicks. nowadays, they don't
* Thus, it's important to find untapped channel strategies - which might mean trying someting different in an established venue. maybe its a venue that no one else is using. You have to jump on the opportunity because these untapped venues will eventually become saturated too

__A note on A/B Testing__

* A/B testing is a scientific experiment with a control group (A) and an experimental group (B)
* The purpose of this kind of testing is to measure the effectiveness of a change in one or more variables (perhaps different font colors, flyer verbiage, etc)
* You create one version of your page for the control group, a second version for the experimental
* By tracking how each page performs, you can find out whether your changes are having a key impact
* Then apply the change and reap the benefits
* A/B testing should be done frequently to help optimize your channel

### Online Tools
* **each test needs a point**: to validate or invalidate specific assumptions you specify ahead of time
* good questions to ask

1. how many prospective customers landed on my website?
2. what are the demographics of my best and worst customers?
3. are customers who interact with my support team more likely to stay customers longer?

* Some basic analytics tools:
  - Clicky
  - Mixpanel
  - Chartbeat
* create a spreadsheet to rank and prioritize traction channels. you should have columns that include:
  - number of available customers
  - conversion rate
  - cost to acquire customer
  - lifetime value of customer
* **does this channel have enough customers to be valuable?**
