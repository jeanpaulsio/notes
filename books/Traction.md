# Traction
* The common startup projectory goes something like this:
* Founders have an idea for a company they're excited about.
* Initial excitement turns into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door.
* The founders expect customers to come racing to their door
* Customers don't care
* Traction is an afterthought.
* They run out of money and their company dies

# Chapter 2 - Traction Thinking

* What do all failed startups have in common? **ans: not enough customers**
* Traction and Product development should get equal attention
* Four common situations:
  - 1. you build something people want but can't figure out a viable business model
  - 2. you build something people want but there aren't enough customers to reach profitability
  - 3. you build something people want but reaching customers is expensive
  - 4. you build something people want but a lot of other companies have built it too
* It's important to work on product development and traction equally when you are starting out
* Parallel product + traction development lets you test different traction channels simultaneously

__Moving the needle__

* It's important to define what traction means for your company
* you need to set a traction goal
* __figure out what traction means in hard numbers__

> startups take off because the founders make them take off ... The most commmon unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all start-ups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out there and get them

# Chapter 3 - Bullseye

## Outer Ring: What's Possible
* It is important to brainstorm every traction channel
* imagine what success looks like in each of the 19 channels
* Each channel should have at least one decent strategy for moving the needle
* look at how similar companies acquired customers over time and how unsuccessful companies wasted their money

## Middle Ring: What's Probable
* Run cheap traction tests in the channels that seem the most promising
* your middle ring should have multiple traction channels and you can run multiple tests at the same time
* for each channel in your middle ring, construct a cheap traction test that will answer the following three questions:
  - 1. how much will it cost to acquire new customers?
  - 2. how many customers are available through this channel?
  - 3. are the kind of customers we get through this channel the kind of customers we want right now?

## Inner Ring: What's Working
* focus SOLELY on the channel that will move the needle the most
* your middle ring should produce promising results
* all resources and efforts should go towards your core channel
* don't be distracted by the other channels that produce - but don't produce as much as your core channel
