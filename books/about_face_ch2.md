# Chapter 2 - Understanding The Problem: Design Research

A designer must know the following about a project in order to succeed:
1. clear and detailed knowledge of the users that s/he is designing for
2. business goals

## Goal-Directed Design Research
Here is the framework:

1. Kickoff meeting
2. literature review
3. product/prototype and competitive audits
4. stakeholder interviews
5. SME interviews
6. user and customer interviews
7. user observations/ethnographic field studies

## Kickoff meeting
* designers should ask initial key questions:
  - what is the product?
  - who will use it?
  - what do your users need the most?
  - which cusotmers and users are the most important to business?
  - who do you see as biggest competitors
  - what external literature should be looked at?

## Literature Review
* internal documents: marketing plans, brand strategy, market research slides, user surveys, etc
* industry reports: business and tech journal articles
* web searches: for releated and competing products

## Product/Prototype and Competitive Audits
* audit the current design and competitive product interfaces
* compare each interaction
* compare visual design principles

## Stakeholder Interviews
* understand the business and technical context surrounding the product
* find out what the business goals are. is it to make more money?
* things to gather from stakeholders:
  - product vision, what is the perspective of the product to be designed
  - budget and schedule
  - technical constraints and opportunities
  - business drivers, what is the business trying to accomplish
  - their perception of their users

## SME Interviews
* SMEs are necessary in complex or specialized domains. if you're designing for a technical domain, you will need SME guidance unless you're an expert  yourself

## Customer Interviews
* customers of a product are those who decide to purchase it. customers and users might not be the same
  - what are a customers goals for purchasing a product?
  - frustrations with current solutions
  - decision process for purchasing a product like the one you're designing?
  - their role in installing, maintaining, and managing the product

## User Interviews
* the people who will actually be using the product to accomplish a goal.
* find out:
  - context of how the product fits into their lives
  - goals and motivations for using the product
  - mental model: how users think about their jobs and activities, as well as their expectations of the product
  - problem and frustrations with the current product

## User Observation
* very beneficial to see how a user actually uses a product

# Ethnographic Research

* goal: understand behavior of people interacting with the products
* during user interviews, when a customer/user suggests something specific, ask them: "what problem would that solve for you?" or "why would that be a good solution?"
* remember, this is __goal driven__
* you want to know what the user's goals are
* encourage story telling. ask users how they use your product, what they think of it, where they go with it, what they're doing when they use it, etc
  - you want to find out how a user interacts and relate to your product
* __avoid leading questions__
