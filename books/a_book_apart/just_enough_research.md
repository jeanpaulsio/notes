# Chapter 2 - The Basics

* Every project boils down to a series of decisions
  - What are the most important features
  - etc..
* research is a set of tools - you need to find the right ones at the right times
  - in order to choose the best research tool for your project, you'll need to know what decisions are in play and what you're asking about
  - then find the best ways to gather info, determine the project's goals and reqs, understand the project's current context, and evaluate potential solutions


## Types of research

__generative/exploratory research: "what's up with....?"__

* this is the research you do before you even know what you're doing
* this leads to ideas and helps define the problem
* this can include interviews, field observations

```
What's up with new tutors on our platform anyway?
```

* the goal is to see the **new tutor experience** from their eyes and to understand **what they do** and **what they need***

__JP, how do I come up with generative/exploratory research?__

* understanding the perspective of a new tutor:
  - interviewing them on the phone
* after interviewing tutors new to our platform on the phone:
  - **determine the most commonly voiced unmet need**
  - come up with a hypothesis on how to meet their needs

__descriptive and explanatory: "what and how?"__

* involves **observing and describing the characteristics of what you're studying**
* This is the type of research that you do when you already have a design problem and you need to do your homework to ensure that you're designing for your audience AND NOT for yourself
* Ask yourself:

```
What is the best way to solve the problem that I've identified?
```

* try to understand both the student and the tutor priorities and experiences
* this is key, what are their *priorities* and *experiences*?

__evaluative research: "are we getting close?"__

* once you have a very clear idea of the problem you're trying to solve, you can begin defining potential solutions
* then you can test the potential solutions to see if they work
* this is an iterative process
* the most common type of evaluative research is usability testing

__casual research: "why is this happening?"__

* why are users responding to your proposed solutions the way that they are?
* establishing a cause-and-effect relationship can be tricky. how do we do this?
  - site analytics
  - review site traffic to see how visitors are entering and moving around your site

## Roles

* Author: plans and writes the study
* Interviewer: interacts directly with participants
