# Chapter 3 - Modeling Users: Personas and Goals
> Personas provide us with a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish, and why

* Personas are not real people
* The best way to design for a variety of people is to design __for specific types of individuals with specific needs__
* Personas **should have motivations in the form of goals**
* **Personas are based on real-world observations**
  - primary source of data used to synthesize personas should be in-context interviews or similar dialogues with observations of potential users

## Goals should be inferred from qualitative data

* Users don't know what their goals are
* If you ask a user directly what their goals are, they'll either be unable to articulate them or give you an imperfectly honest answer
* People are not prepared to answer self-reflective questions
* THUS, we must construct the user's goal by observing their behavior, answers to other questions, nonverbal cues from the environment, etc
* **this is why qualitative data from real user interviews and interactions is important** otherwise, when you create a persona not backed by qualitative data, you're basically just injecting your own assumptions and painting a picture based on your own judgment. sometimes this is all you can do (with limited resources) but you have to acknowledge that personas created without qualitative data are just stand-ins until you can

## Three types of user goals

1. __Experience Goals__: these goals are simple, universal, and personal. they *express how a person wants to feel* while using a product. these goals provide a focus for a product's visual and aural characteristics
2. __End Goals__: these goals represent the user's motivation for performing tasks associated with using a specific product. there are certain expectations a user has when using a product
3. __Life Goals__: represent the user's personal aspirations that go beyond the context of the product being designed

__understanding personas is more about understanding motivations and goals that it is about understanding specific tasks or demographics__

## Constructing Personas

1. group interview subjects by role
2. identify behavioral traits
3. map interview subjects to behavioral variables
4. identify significant behavior patterns
5. synthesize characteristics and define goals
6. check for completeness and redundancy
7. designate persona types
8. expand the description of attributes and behaviors

### 1. group interview subjects by role

* for enterprise applications, roles are easier to delineate because they usually map to job descriptions
* consumer products have more subtle role divisions - they can include family roles, attitudes, or approaches to relevant activities, or interests and aptitudes regarding lifestyle choices

### 2. identify behavioral traits

* list distinct aspects of observed behavior for each role as a set
* distinction between behavior patterns emerge by focusing on these variables:
  - Activities: what a user does; frequency and volume
  - Attitudes: How the user thinks about the product domain and technology
  - Aptitudes: What education and training te user has; their ability to learn
  - Motivations: Why the user is engaged in the product domain
  - Skills: User abilities related to the product domain and technology
* it is typical to have about 15-30 different variables

### 3. map interview subjects to behavioral variables

* mapping each interviewee to a precise point in the range isn't as important as **identifying the placement of interviewees in relationship to each other**


```
service                                    price
oriented                                  oriented
    |-----------------------------------------|
  user 1,          user 2                   user 4,
  user 3                                    user 5
```

### 4. identify significant behavior patterns

* Look for clusters of subjects that occur across multiple ranges or variables
* A set of users who cluster in six to eight different variables are typically indicative of a significant behavioral pattern
* For example, you might find a behavioral pattern that shows that people who are regular buyers of CDs also download MP3s

### 5. synthesize characteristics and define goals

* a persona's goals and other attributes are *derived from their behaviors!!!*
* behaviors are synthesized from what you have observed in the research process, think of this as a day in the life of your user
* For each behavioral pattern, synthesize the following details:
  - the behavior itself (activities and motivations behind them)
  - the use environments
  - frustrations and pain points related to the behavior using current solutions
  - demographics associated with the behavior
  - skills, experiences, or abilities relating to the behavior
  - attitudes and emotions associated with the behavior
  - relevant interactions with other people, products, and services
  - alternate or competing ways of doing the same thing, especially with analog techniques
* only write brief bullet points and stick to observed behaviors as much as possible. remember, you are using this as a design tool. too much *fictional information* can be distracting
* this is the meat and potatoes
* names can be generated using [http://random-name-generator.info](http://random-name-generator.info)

__Defining Goals__

* you can infer goals both by observing user's actions (what interview subjects in each persona cluster are trying to accomplish and why) and by analyzing subject responses to goal-oriented interview questions
* A reminder - Goal oriented interview question examples:
  - Goals: what makes a good day? a bad day?
  - Opportunity: What activities currently waste your time?
  - Priorities: WHat is most important to you?
  - Information: What helps you make decisions?
* __Goals must be related to the product being designed__


### 6. check for completeness and redundancy

* sometimes you need to make a political persona to satisfy stakeholder assumptions or requests
* this is the stage where you make sure that your personas are **meaningfully distinct**

### 7. designate persona types

* by now, your personas should **feel like real people**. remember that they **AREN'T** real people
* remember that design requires a target - the audience upon whom the design is focused on
* your goal is to find a single persona (**your primary persona**) whose needs you can satisfy entirely without disenfranchising your other personas
* you can categorize your personas in the following categories:
  - __primary__: main target of interface, will not be satisifed if the product is designed for any other persona type
  - __secondary__: mostly satisified by primary persona's interface but has specific additional needs. you shouldnt have too many of these types
  - __supplemental__: needs are a combination of primary and secondary needs
  - __customer__: address the needs of customers, not the end users
  - __served__: address the people that aren't customers or end users, but the types of people that are affected by the product
  - __negative__: the kind of people you **don't** want to target
* You can and **SHOULD only have one primary** persona type

### 8. expand the description of attributes and behaviors

* Create a third person narrative to convey a persona's attitudes, needs, and problems
* this will help you develop empathy
* your narrative should be no longer than a page - just a small paragraph for each of the bullet points that you listed in step 5
* must contain some fictional situations, but remember that this isn't a short story

> The best narrative quickly introduces the persona in terms of his job or lifestyle. it briefly sketches a day in his life, including peeves, concerns, and interests taht have direct bearing on the product

* the narrative should express what the persona is looking for in the product by way of conclusion
* add photograph for your persona:
  - __Do not__ use photos with weird camera angles
  - __Do not__ use photos with exaggerated expressions
  - __Do not__ use photos where people are obviously posed and smiling for the camera
  - __DO__ use photos where the subjects look like average people
  - __DO__ use photos where the subject is engaged in an appropriate activity against a realistc background
    + it can also be helpful to create a sort of collage that will help you paint a day in the life of. other images in your collage may include activities that the subject might engage in, etc
