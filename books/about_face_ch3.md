# Chapter 3 - Modeling Users: Personas and Goals
> Personas provide us with a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish, and why

* Personas are not real people
* Personas are just composite archetypes based on behavior patterns discovered from our research
* The best way to design for a variety of people is to design __for specific types of individuals with specific needs__
* When you design for everyone, you design for no one
* Personas **should have motivations in the form of goals**
* If your model doesn't have any goals, you don't have a persona

## Goals should be inferred from qualitative data

* Users don't know what their goals are
* If you ask a user directly what their goals are, they'll either be unable to articulate them or give you an imperfectly honest answer
* People are not prepared to answer self-reflective questions
* THUS, we must construct the user's goal by observing their behavior, answers to other questions, nonverbal cues from the environment, etc

## Three types of user goals

1. __Experience Goals__: these goals are simple, universal, and personal. they *express how a person wants to feel* while using a product. these goals provide a focus for a product's visual and aural characteristics
2. __End Goals__: these goals represent the user's motivation for performing tasks associated with using a specific product. there are certain expectations a user has when using a product
3. __Life Goals__: represent the user's personal aspirations that go beyond the context of the product being designed

__understanding personas is more about understanding motivations and goals that it is about understanding specific tasks or demographics__
