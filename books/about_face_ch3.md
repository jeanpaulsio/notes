# Chapter 3 - Modeling Users: Personas and Goals
> Personas provide us with a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish, and why

* Personas are not real people
* Personas are just composite archetypes based on behavior patterns discovered from our research
* The best way to design for a variety of people is to design __for specific types of individuals with specific needs__
* When you design for everyone, you design for no one
* Personas **should have motivations in the form of goals**
* If your model doesn't have any goals, you don't have a persona
