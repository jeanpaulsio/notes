# Chapter 2 - A Pragmatic Approach

## Tip 16: Prototype to learn

__JP__: I love doing this during "exploration" - careful not to use prototypes in prod ðŸ‘€

**John:** prototype vs tracer bullet - Expectations: Remind them that you can build a great prototype of a new car out of balsa wood and duct tape, but you wouldn't try to drive it in rush-hour traffic! - Localhost with ngrok

## Tip 17: Program Close to the problem domain

__JP__: Remember to focus on domain problems and not petty implementation details

**John:** Let your code be english! - Let it reflect the way your team talks. `execute_email_delivery_protical` vs `send_email`

## Tip 18: Estimate to avoid surprises

__JP__: Be deliberate and keep track... wording is key (i.e. specificity)

**John:** Reality - scope is a Moving target - Tracer code and testing helps make sure estimates are well thought out. Charge to estimate / mockup.

## Tip 19: Iterate the schedule with code

__JP__: Keep an open line of communication about expectations for scheduling

**John:** What to say when you are asked for an estimate "I'll get back to you" - Scope can be revised. Not just timeline.
