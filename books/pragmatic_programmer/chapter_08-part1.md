design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter.

JP: This is part 1 of Chapter 8

# 60 - Organize teams around functionality

> Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you would build code.


# 61 - Don't use manual procedures

> A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time


# 62 - Test early. Test often. Test automatically

> Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on the shelf.


# 63 - Coding ain't done till all the tests run

> 'nuff said


# 64 - Use saboteurs to test your testing

> Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.
