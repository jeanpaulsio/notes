# Chapter 8 - Pragmatic Projects

## Season 2 - Episode 13 - Chapter 8 Part 2

John: Welcome to Iteration: A weekly podcast about programming, development, and
design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter.

JP: This is part 2 of Chapter 8 - THE FINAL CHAPTER!


# 65 - Test state coverage, not code coverage

> Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn't enough

JP: Even if you test every single line of code - that's not what matters. What matters is how many different permutations of your app's state you have covered. *drops mic*

# 66 - Find bugs once

> Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.

JP: We don't have time to find a bug more than once... "We have to spend our time writing new code - and new bugs"

# 67 - English is just a programming language

> Write docs as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, auto generation and so on

JP: don't dread writing docs. it's part of your application. i think this tip is phrased in such a way to appeal to engineers. think of documentation writing as writing code, not writing literature

# 68 - Build documentation in, don't bolt it on

> Documentation created seperately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date

JP: sometimes you need documentation. obviously, name your variables well, but sometimes explain what a function does or why it does it. at OL we'll sometimes write include the github issue number for a weird quirk or to explain why a test is testing for certain functionality. treat docs like code. part of the code, not separate from it

# 69 - Gently exceed your users' expectations

> Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.

JP: "Never lose sight of the business problems your application is intended to solve".

# 7- - Sign your work

> Craftspeople of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too

"Anonymity, especially on large projects, can provide a breeding ground for sloppiness, mistakes, sloth, and bad code. [...] We want to see pride of ownership. Your signature should come to be recognized as an indicator of quality. A really professional job. Written by a real programmer. A Pragmatic Progammer"

JP: lol, git blame
