# Chapter 8 - Pragmatic Projects

## Season 2 - Episode 13 - Chapter 8 Part 2

John: Welcome to Iteration: A weekly podcast about programming, development, and
design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter.

JP: This is part 2 of Chapter 8 - THE FINAL CHAPTER!


# 65 - Test state coverage, not code coverage

> Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn't enough

# 66 - Find bugs once

> Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.

# 67 - English is just a programming language

> Write docs as yhou would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, auto generation and so on

# 68 - Build documentation in, don't bolt it on

> Documentation created seperately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date

# 69 - Gently exceed your users' expectations

> Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.

# 7- - Sign your work

> Craftspeople of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too
