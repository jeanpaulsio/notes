JP: Welcome to **PART 1** of Chapter 7: "Before The Project"

# 51 - Don't Gather Requirements - Dig For Them

> Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They're buried deep beneath the layers
> of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics

# 52 - Work with a User to Think like a user

> It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used

# 53 - Abstractions Live Longer than Details

> Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive
> the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies

# 54 - Use a Project Glossary

> Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary
> for a project

# 55 - Don't think outside the box - find the box

> When faced with an impossible problem, identify the _real_ constraints. Ask
> yourself: "Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?"
