# Chapter 6 - Pragmatic Programer:

John: Welcome to Iteration: A weekly podcast about programming, development, and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter.

JP: This is part 2 of chapter 6, "While you are coding". Last week we talked about pragmatic practices while you are coding.

## Part 2

### Tip 47 Refactor Early, Refactor Often

> Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem


### Tip 48 Design to Test

> Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code

### Tip 49 Test Your Software, or Your Users Will

> Test ruthlessly. Don't make your users find bugs for you.

### Tip 50 Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand

> Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project
