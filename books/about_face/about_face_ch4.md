# Chapter 4 - Setting the Vision: Scenarios and Design Requirements

This is where we link research and product design. How does it all fit together in a way that satisfies user and business needs?

__Requirements Definition Process__

1. Create problem and vision statement
2. Explore / brainstorm
3. Identify persona expectations
4. Construct context scenarios
5. Identify design requirements

Remember that this is an iterative process. Designers typically iterate through steps 3 through 5 until the requirements are stable

## 1 Create problem and Vision statement

__problem statement__

* defines the purpose of a design initiative. a design problem statement reflects the situation that needs changing for both the personas AND the business. we can boil this down to a cause-and-effect relationship

> Company X has low customer satisfaction. Market share has diminished because users have inadequate tools to perform X, Y, and Z that would help meet their goals of G.

* connecting business issues to usability issues is key for stakeholders

__vision statement__

*you lead with user's needs and transition from those to how the design vision meets business goals.
* this is a sort of an inverse to the problem statement

> The new design of Product X will help users achieve G by allowing them to do X, Y, and Z with greater efficiency. This will improve Company X's user satisfaction

* these are helpful when redesigning an existing product
* they should come from user research
* you are formulating user goals and frustrations into problem/vision statements

## 2 Explore / Brainstorm

* air all of the wacky and crazy ideas that youve been thinking about
* the goal of this stage is to just air out all of your preconceptions
* don't spend too much time on this step

## 3 Identify Persona expectations

* remember that a persona's mental model is his/her own internal representation of reality - how a user explains something to themself
* record your primary persona's expectations and write them down
  - attitudes, experiences, aspirations, and other social/cultural/environmental and cognitive factors that influence a persona's expectations
  - general expectations and desires the persona may have about the experience using the product
  - behaviors the persona will expect or what from the product
  - how the persona thinks about basic elements or units of data

## 4 Construct context scenarios

* a context scenario tells the story of a particular user persona, with various motivations, needs, and goals
* it describes the broad context in which that persona's usage patterns are exhibited
* __this is where design begins__
* as you develop context scenarios, start thinking of ways that the product you are designing can best achieve a user's goals
* context scenarios should be broad and shallow in scope
* context scenarios should focus on high-level actions

__address the following with context scenarios__

* what setting will the product be used
* will it be used for extended amounts of time
* is the persona frequently interrupted?
* do several people use a single workstation or device
* with what other products will it be used
* what primary activities does the persona need to perform to meet their goals
* what is the epxected end result of using the product
* how much complexity is permissable, based on persona skill and frequency of use

## Example Context Scenario

Remember to keep these high level without getting too specific about interfaces or technologies

Context: A persona in the context of using a personal digital assistant type phone - including the device and the service

(refer to page 114)

> Pretend the interface is magic. If your persona has goals and the product has magic powers to meet them, how simpole could the interaction be?

* Magic solutions obviously don't exist but this exercise can help in making a good UX. you end up creating a product that meet's a user's goals with minimum hassle and intrusion

## 5 Identify Design Requirements

* remember, requirements __are not features or tasks__

_Call (action) a person (object) directly from an appointment (context)_

__A Whiz Tutor Example__

_Book (action) a tutor (object) directly from their profile (context)_

* You can think of requirements in four different categories

### 1. Data Requirements

* objects and information that must be represented in the system:
  - accounts, people, addresses, documents, messages, images, etc as well as attributes for those things

### 2. Functional Requirements

* operations or actions that need to be performed on the system's objects and that typically are translated into interface controls
* think of these as a product's actions

### 3. Contextual Requirements

* describe relationships or dependencies between sets of objects in the system
* this can include which objects in the system need to be displayed together to make sense for work flow or to meet specific persona goals
  - For example, When booking a tutor, it makes sense to include a **subject** and a **Location** on the booking confirmation page

### 4. Other Requirements

* business requirements
* brand and experience requirements
* technical requirements
* customer and partner requirements
