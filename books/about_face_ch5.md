# Chapter 5 - Designing the Product: Framework and Refinement

Now we're ready to design!

## Creating a Design Framework

* a design framework defines the overall structure of the user's experience
  - includes the underlying organizing principles and the arrangement of functional elements on screen, workflows, interactive behaviors and the visual and form languages used to express info

> When it comes to the design of complex behaviors and interactions, we've found that focusing too early on pixel pushing, widget design, and specific interactions can get in the way of effectively designing a comprehensive framework in which all the product's behaviors can fit

## Defining the Interaction Framework

Screen layouts, product's flow, behavior, and organization

1. Define form factor, posture, and input methods

* **Form**: is it a web app? mobile app? viewed on a high resolution screen? etc
* a product's **posture** is related to how much attention the user will devote to interacting with the product and how the product's behaviors respond to the kind of attention the user will devote to it
* the **input** method is how the users will interact with the product


2. Define functional and data elements

* data elements are the fundamental subjects of interactive products. these objects (photos, email messages, orders, etc) are the basic units to be referred to, responded to, and acted on by the people using the product
* your elements should fit with the User persona's mental models
* functionale elements are the operations that can be done to the data elements and their representations in the interface
  - tools to act on and ways to visually and structurally manage data elements
  - a functional element might be a form to input a subject in order to find a specific type of tutor

__pretend your product is human__

* it needs to work like magic

> Interactions with a digital system should be similar in tone and helpfulness to interactions with a polite, considerate human

* What would a helpful human do?

3. Determine functional groups and hierarchy

* begin to group your functional and data elements and determine their hierarchy. consider the following:
  - Which elements need a large amount of screen real estate? which do not?
  - which elements are containers for other elements?
  - How should containers be arranged to optimize flow?
  - Which elements are used together?
  - In what sequence will related elements be used?
  - What data elements would be useful  for the persona to know?
  - How do personas' mental models affect organization?
* try to figure out which screens/states/views need to exist

4 . Sketch the interaction framework

* start super simple, use rectangles, and put actual pen to paper.

> A study found that pencil-like sketches encourage discourse about a proposed design and also increased understanding of the renderings as representing works in progress

* Remember that this is an iterative process. don't get too caught up in the details and pixel pushing
* you may want to sketch different ways of fitting together top-level containers. have boxes represent different functional elements and see how they work together

5. Construct Key Path Scenarios

* a key path scenario describes how the persona interacts with the product, using vocabularyh of the interaction framework
* these scenarios depict the primary pathways that your persona takes with the most frequency
* these are task-oriented rather than goal oriented
* they must __describe in detail the behavior of each major interaction and provide a walkthrough of each major pathway__
* storyboarding can help

## Defining the visual design framework

1. Develop experience attributes

* choose 3-5 adjectives to help define the tone, voice, and brand promise of the product. these keywords are experience attributes

2. Develop visual langauge studies

* explore a variety of visual treatments to a certain aspect of your product to test the waters with stakeholders
* visual studies should relate to personas' experience goals

3. Apply chosen visual style to screen archetype

* choose one or two key screens and apply the design to it. by now the design has begun to stabalize. further refinements can be made to the key screen without having to go too deep into other screens


## Testing Testing Testing

* user feedback sessions and usability tests are good at identifying major problems with the interaction framework and at refining things like button lavels and activity order
* you can give usability tests where __users are asked to complete a predetermined set of tasks__


## What To Tests

Usability tests are good at validating the following:

* Naming: do section/button labels make sense? Do certain words resonate more
* Organization: is information grouped into meaningful categories? Are items located in the places customers might look for them
* First time use and discoverability: Are common items easy for new users to find? are instructions clear?
* Effectiveness: can customers efficiently complete specific tasks. are they making missteps? where? how often?
