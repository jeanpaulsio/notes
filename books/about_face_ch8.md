# Digital Etiquette

> The computer does the work, and the person does the thinking

* If we want users to like our products, we should design them to behave in the same manner as a likeable person


> Software should behave like a considerate human being

* If an interactive product is stingy with information, obscures its processes, forces users to hunt around for common functions, and is quick to blame people for its own failings, users are going to have a bad time
