> when designers focus on peoples goals - the reasons why they use a product in the first place - as well as their expectations, attitudes, and aptitudes, they can devise solutions that people find both powerful and pleasurable to use

# PART 1 - Goal Oriented Design
# Chapter 1 - A Design Process for Digital Products
* When businesses shortchange design for technology and market data, it results it products that people **hate**

## Why Digital Projects Fail
* Misplaced Priorities
  - marketers and developers prioritize things differently, without the user in mind
  - marketers make the mistake of asking users what they want. often times, people dont know what they want
  - sometimes developers are forced to make decisions within their technical capabilities
* Ignorance of real users
* Conflict of interest
  - dev. team usually has final say on what's build. it's easy for them to pick and choose what to build
* Lack of design process
  - you need a **repeatable, predictable, and analytical process for ensuring desirability**

## Planning and Designing Product Behavior
* Not a matter of aesthetic choice, but rather based on understanding of users and cognitive principles
* Achieving user goals via appropriately designed behaviors
* Goal Oriented Design: understanding a user's goals, needs and movtivations
* We need to understand a user's mental models because these drive their goals

## Recognizing User Goals

> When the design meets the user's personal goals, business goals are achieved far more effectively

## How do interfaces fail?
* makes users feel stupid
* causes users to make big mistakes
* require too much effort to operate effectively
* don't provide an engaging or enjoyable experience

## Goals versus Tasks/Activities
* __Goal__: expectation of an end condition
* __Task/Activity__: intermediate steps that help someone reach a goal
* By focusing on tasks and activities, you might not satisfy the user's goals

## Implementation Models vs Mental Models
* an *implementation model* is basically how somethinig works behind the scenes
* a *mental* model is a user's expectations or assumptions of how something works.
* between the two is called a designer's *represented model*. this is how a designer represents an implementation's inner workings

Think of when you put a filter on a photo on instagram. Instagram does this very well. You see a filter's name and a representation of how it affects your photo. You just click it and boom, the filter is applied in the same way to your image. What the UX'ers have done is hid the implementation details. A given filter might change the photo's hue, saturation, contrast, etc. Instead of showing you the raw details in numbers (implementation), you are given just a *representation*. This representation matches your expectation of what's to happen.

## Goal Directed Design
* Design should **not** be a visual facelift of an implementation model
* There's is a bridge that needs to be gapped. Let's say we get all this research. What do we do with it? It's not as if obtaining user research spits back out a design solution ready for you to use
* Thus, there is a process to bridging this gap - a framework, if you will. It has 6 Steps:

1. __Research:__ observations, contextual interviews of potential users. includes stakeholder interviews, and so on. from this research you can begin to see behavioral patterns that indicate goals and motivations. this also helps you define user personas
2. __Modeling:__ user models, personas, etc. helps developers and marketers understand the design rationale
3. __Requirement Definition:__ scenario based design methods; focus on goals of user personas
4. __Framework Definition:__ designers create the overall product concept; provide basic framework for product behavior, visual design and physical form.
