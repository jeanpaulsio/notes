## Recording September 4, 2019

> Welcome to Iteration: a weekly podcast about programming, development, and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter by chapter

> My name is John, and I am joined by JP

> Today we will be covering a topic that we can all relate to: planning.

## Chapter 12 - Planning: Managing Scope

> Planning is an exercise in listening, speaking, and aligning goals for a specific time period. It is valuable input for each team member. Without planning, we are individuals with haphazard connections and effectiveness. We are a team when we plan and work in harmony.

XP recommends planning at _any_ timescale with these four steps.

1.) List the items of work that may need to be done.
2.) Estimate the items.
3.) Set a budget for the planning cycle.
4.) Agree on the work that nees to be done within the budget. As you negotiate, don't change the estimates or the budget.

## Questions for discussion

- **Question 1:** Walk us through how you plan a new feature. In other words, how do you bring a new idea from concept to reality?

- **Question 2:** How do you decide when a feature is in scope vs. out of scope?

- **Question 3:** Talk about a time when planninng failed and scope creep was real. How do you think this could have been prevented?
