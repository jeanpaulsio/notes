# Chapter 10 - The Whole XP Team

> A variety of people must work together in interlinking ways to make a project more effective. They have to work together as a group for each to be successful.

TLDR: what should each of these roles do on an XP team?

- **Tester** - find the happy path; find ways to break it
- **Interaction Designer** - choose overall metaphors for the system; create personas and goals; help the team analyze and make sense of the world;
- **Product Managers** - write stories; pick themes and stories in quarterly cycles; prioritizes; encourage communication between customers and programmers

ok... we don't have to go through all of these. Not sure we really need to discuss much of this chapter
