# Chapter 9 - Corollary Practices (pg 61-71)

corollary: noun, a proposition that follows from one already proved. e.g. "The huge increases in unemployment were the corollary of expenditure cuts.

TLDR: Walk before you run

## Real Customer Involvement

> The point of customer involvement is to reduce wasted effort by putting the people with the needs in direct contact with the people who can fill those needs.

- 🌵things I’ve missed from not including customers: block width buttons, “bookings” language, “clickable cards” SO much is missed without really involving customers. 


## Root Cause Analysis

> (After you write tests and fix the bug...) Once the defect is resolved, figure out _why_ the defect was created and wasn't caught. Initiate the necesssary changes to precvent this kind of defect in the future

- Five Whys
- 🌵 **Five whys**
- Opendoor post-mortems
- hint: it's usually a people-problem

## 🌵 Incremental Development 

- "Slices" [concept from Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-10#integrating-in-one-place)
- Scoping the work into a very tiny working piece of functionality and incrementing work from there. 
	- If you were to rebuild facebook, just create a "Wall" and a "newsfeed", leave "likes" or "comments" for a future iteration. 

## 🌵 Negotiated scope contract
- Magic formula for success as an agency: 
- It's taken me 4+ years of freelance software development to learn this lesson. 
- Scope is flexible, budget, time quality are not. 
- This is a game-changer, learn this as early as possible. 


## Other practices

- shared code
- single code base
- daily deployment
- etc

# Chapter 10 - The Whole XP Team

🌵 I think we are good to just provide a hit list of "Roles" in a software team. 

> A variety of people must work together in interlinking ways to make a project more effective. They have to work together as a group for each to be successful.

TLDR: what should each of these roles do on an XP team?

- **Tester** - find the happy path; find ways to break it
- **Interaction Designer** - choose overall metaphors for the system; create personas and goals; help the team analyze and make sense of the world;
- **Product Managers** - write stories; pick themes and stories in quarterly cycles; prioritizes; encourage communication between customers and programmers
- **Project Managers** Facilitate communication, help identify priorities and consistent accountability. 
- **Executives**  Courage, confidence and accountability

ok... we don't have to go through all of these. Not sure we really need to discuss much of this chapter
