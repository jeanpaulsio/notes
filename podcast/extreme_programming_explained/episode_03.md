> A weekly podcast about programming, development, and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter

Hi, I'm John and I'm joined by JP.

Today we will be going through chapter 5 and continuing our discussion about the guiding principles of Extreme Programming.

* Intros
* Chit Chat

> Values are too abstract to directly guide behavior. (This is why we discuss things in the context of principles)

_____Other principles may guide your team, but these are the principles that guide XP__

* Humanity
* Economics
* Mutual benefit
* Self-similarity
* Improvement
* Diversity
* Reflection
* Flow
* Opportunity
* Redundancy
* Failure
* Quality
* Baby steps
* Accepted responsibility

Now obviously we aren't going to bore you with discussion on all 14 of these principles, so today we'll only talk about a handful of them.

## Humanity - noun, the characteristics that make us human

__Copy and paste alert__

What do people need to be good developers? What are some basic human needs?

* Safety - freedom from hunger, physical harm and threats to loved ones. Fear of job loss threatens this
* Accomplishment - opportunity to contribute to their society
* Belonging - ability to identify with a group from which they receive validation
* Growth - opportunity to expand their skills and perspective
* Intimacy - ability to understand and be understood by others

Interestingly, satisfying these requisites meets both business and human needs.

## Economics

* Make sure what you're doing has business value, meets business goals, and serves busines needs
* Decisions (investments) today should pay off _tomorrow_

## Mutual Benefit

* Searching for practices that benefit me now, me later, and my customer as well: i.e. writing automated, self-documenting tests; writing simpler code; choosing coherent variable names and an explicit set of metaphors


## Diversity

> Software development teams where everyone is alike, while comfotable, are not effective. Teams need to bring together a variety of skills, attitudes, and perspectives to see problems and pitfalls, to think of multiple ways to solve problems, and to implement the solutions. Teams need diversity


> The principle of diversity suggets that the programmers should work together on the problem and both opinions should be valued.

## Failure

> If you're having trouble succeeding, fail. Don't know which of the three ways to implement a story? Try it all three ways.

> When you don't know what to do, risking failure can be the shortest, surest road to success

Conclusion:

* Principles give you a better idea of what the practice is intended to accomplish
* Understanding the principles gives you the opportunity to create practices that work in harmony with your existing practices and your overall goals
