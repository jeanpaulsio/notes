## Chapter 13 - Testing Early, Often, and Automated

> Here is the dilemma in software development: defects are expensive, but eliminating defects is also expensive.

Instead of talking about having a kick-ass automated test suite, frequently testing code, and all of that good stuff, we should talk about something a little different.

We don't need to bore you by talking about tests.

Here are some fun questions we can talk about:

- What was the last big bug you can think of? How did you handle it?
- What was the reason for the latest big bug?
- How do you handle bugs in general?
