# Season 7 Episode 4 (page 35 - 60)

## Recording August 7, 2019

> A weekly podcast about programming, development, and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter by chapter

John: Hi, I'm John and I'm joined by JP.

JP: Today we will be going through chapters 6, 7, and 8 for those following alone - which are all about Extreme Programming practices. These are the things that XP teams are doing on a daily basis. Kent Beck defines two categories for practices: Primary Practices and Corollary Practices. You must first master the primary practices before considering corollary ones. This episode focuses on primary practices.

Practices that do not serve a purpose or have values are empty. For example, pair programming for the sake of making your boss happy doesn't make much sense. However, pair programming to communicate, get feedback, simplify the system, catch errors, and bolster courage makes a lot of sense.

# Primary Practices (Chapter 7)

## Sit together

> XP predicts that the more face time you have, the more humane and productive the project.

👨‍🏫 humanity
👨‍🏫 improvment
👨‍🏫 quality

## Whole team

## Informative workspace

> Make your workspace about work. An interested observer should be able to walk into the team space and get a general idea of how the project is going in 15 seconds.

👨‍🏫 mutual benefit - doing stuff today that benefits me now and in the future
👨‍🏫 flow

## Energized work 🔥

> Work only as many hours as you can be productive and only as many hours as you can sustain. Burning yourself out unproductively today and spoiling the next two days' work isn't good for you or for the team.

> Taking care of yourself is the quickest way back to energized work.

> I turn to long work hours as a way of grabbing control in a situation in which I am otherwise out of control

👨‍🏫 flow
👨‍🏫 humanity
👨‍🏫 improvment
👨‍🏫 mutual benefit

Hot tips:

➡️ stay the same amount of time but manage time better
➡️️️️️ block off 2 hours at a time in your calendar just for coding
➡️ turn off phone, email, and slack notifications

## Pair programming

## Stories

> Plan using customer-visible functionality. "Handle vie times the traffic with the same response time". As soon as the story is written, try to estimate the development effort necessary to implement it.

> Write stories on index cards and put them on a frequently passed wall. Every attempt I've seen to computerize stories has failed to provide a fraction of the value of having real cards on a real wall.

👨‍🏫 flow
👨‍🏫 reflection
👨‍🏫 quality

##- Weekly cycle (hehe, sprints)

## Quarterly cycle

## Slack

> In any plan, include some minor tasks that can be dropped if you get behind.

Under promise, over deliver!

> I had been watching first-hand the incredible waste generated by their habitual overcommitment: unmanageable defect loads, dismal morale, and antagonistic relationships. Meeting commitments, even modest ones, eliminates waste. Clear, honest communication relieves tension and improves credibility.

👨‍🏫 humanity (accomplishment)
👨‍🏫 economics
👨‍🏫 improvment
👨‍🏫 quality

## Ten-minute build

## Continuous integration

## Test-first programming 🙅‍♀️

**I, JP Sio, am not allowed to talk about this subject**

## Incremental design

> Invest in the design of the system every day. Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day.

> XP teams work hard to create conditions under which the cost of changing the software doesn't rise catastrophically. The automated tests, the continual practice of improving the design, and the explicit social process all contribute to keep the cost of changes low.

> XP teams meet their human need for immediate and frequent success [...]

👨‍🏫 humanity
👨‍🏫 baby steps
👨‍🏫 accpeted responsibility
👨‍🏫 reflection

# Getting Started (Chapter 8)

REMEMBER! XP is a way to improve both your development process and your experience in it.

- adapt by adding practices that meet your goals and express your values
- you don't have to implement all of the practices at once. pick one, see how they meet your goals and align with your values.
- baby steps!

> Change always starts at home. The only person you can actually change is yourself. [...] Dictating practices to a team destroys trust and creates resentment.

- lead by example
