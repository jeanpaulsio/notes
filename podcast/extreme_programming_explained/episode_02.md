## Chapter 2 - Learning to Drive

* frequent, small corrections
* don't wait to find out if you are going in the wrong direction

## Chapter 3 - Values, Principles, and Practices


* __values__ are the roots of things we like and don't like in a situation.

> Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become rote (habitual repetition), activities performed for their own sake buck lacking any purpose or direction.

* __practices__ are evidence of values

> Practices are clear. Everyone knows if I've attended the morning standup meetings. Whether I really _value_ communication is fuzzy. Whether I maintain practices that enhance communication is concrete.

* __principles__ bridge the gap between values and practices

## Chapter 4 - Values

Chapters 2 and 3 are small introductory sections, here is the TLDR:

```
Software, teams, and requirements change. We need to be able to adapt
to such change. The next 3 sections will be about values, practices,
and principles of Extreme Programming
```

__Chapter 4 is about values__

> Everyone who touches software has a sense of what matters. One person might think what really matters is carefully thinking through all conceivable design decisions before implementing. Another might think what really matters is not having any restrictions on his own personal freedom.

> What actually matters is not how any given person behaves as much as how the individuals behave as part of a team and as part of an organization.

* Sometimes it's easy to bikeshed over things like code style. Arrow functions vs function declaration, inline functions vs methods, etc

__XP embraces 5 values to guide development__

```
1. Communication
2. Simplicity
3. Feedback
4. Courage
5. Respect
```

### 1. Communication

> When you encounter a problem, ask yourselves if the problem was caused by a lack of communication. What communication do you need now to address the problem? What communication do you need to keep yourself out of this trouble in the future?

### 2. Simplicity
### 3. Feedback
### 4. Courage
### 5. Respect
