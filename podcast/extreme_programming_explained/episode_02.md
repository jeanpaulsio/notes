# Season 7 Epsiode 2

## Recording on July 10, 2019

> A weekly podcast about programming, development, and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter

---

## Chapter 2 - Learning to Drive

> Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The business changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn't change, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is our inability to cope with change.

* frequent, small corrections
* don't wait to find out if you are going in the wrong direction

> Just as the customers steer the content of the system, the whole team steers the development process, beginning with its current set of practices

* JP: Firsthand experience of seeing things change with the Opendoor acquisition of Open Listings.

## Chapter 3 - Values, Principles, and Practices

> Where I might be proud of my ability to correctly prune a branch, Paul might see that the whole tree should come out. [...] I have to work at what is simple and obvious to him.


* __values__ are the roots of things we like and don't like in a situation.

> Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become rote (habitual repetition), activities performed for their own sake buck lacking any purpose or direction.

* __practices__ are evidence of values

> Practices are clear. Everyone knows if I've attended the morning standup meetings. Whether I really _value_ communication is fuzzy. Whether I maintain practices that enhance communication is concrete.

* __principles__ bridge the gap between values and practices

## Chapter 4 - Values

Chapters 2 and 3 are small introductory sections, here is the TLDR:

```
Software, teams, and requirements change. We need to be able to adapt to such change. The next 3 sections will be about values, practices, and principles of Extreme Programming
```
