__Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz__

## In Praise of Design

* The world is just a series of spontaneous interactions between object
* OO apps are made up of parts that interact to produce behavior as a whole
* interactions are embodied as messages that pass between them

## The Tools of Design
## The Act of Design
## A Brief Intro to OO Programming

* Class based
* objects have behavior that may contain data
* Objects invoke one another's behavior by sending each other messages
* Consider the String object in Ruby - operations are built into the string object themselves, not the languages syntax
* Each OO application gradually becomes a unique programming language that is specifically tailored to your domain
