# Chapter 7 - Sharing Role Behavior with Modules

From the previous chapter, we talked about classical inheritance. We started out with 3 bicycles:

- root bike
- road bike
- mountain bike

... but what if we wanted a "road, mountain bike"

> Use of classical inheritance is always optional; every problem it solves can be solved another way. [...] This chapter explores an alternative that uses the techniques of inheritance to share a **role**.

## Understanding Roles

## Writing inheritable Code

## Summary

> Modules, therefore, should use the template method pattern to invite those that include them to supply specializations, and should implement hook methods to avoid forcing includers to send super (and thus know the algorithm).
