# Chapter 9 - Designing Cost Effective Tests

Writing Changeable code requires 3 skills

1. understanding OO
2. "Second, you must be skilled at refactoring code. Not in the casual sense of 'go into the application and fling some things around,' but in the real, grown-up, bullet-proof sense defined by Martin Fowler in _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_
3. writing high value tests

# Intentional Testing

> Intentionally depending on interfaces allows you to use tests to put off design decisions safely and without penalty

> If a test requires painful setup, the code expects too much context. If testing one object drags a bunch of others intothe mix, the code has too many dependencies. If the test is hard to write, other objects will find the code difficult to reuse. [...] Your goal is to gain all of the benefits of testing for the least cost possible. The best way to acheive this goal is to write loosely coupled tests about __only the things that matter__
