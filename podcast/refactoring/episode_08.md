# Episode 8 - Recap

- two distinct activities: adding functionality and refactoring.

> When I add functionality, I shouldn't be changing existing code; I'm just adding new capabilities. [...] When I refactor, I make a point of not adding functionality; I only restructure code.

## When ?

tl;dr - all the time

- preparatory refactoring, just before adding a new feature
- comprehension refactoring, making code easier to understand before diving in

> It's a common error to see refactoring as something people do to fix past mistakes or clean up ugly code. Certainly you have to refactor when you run into ugly code, but excellent code needs plenty of refactoring too.
