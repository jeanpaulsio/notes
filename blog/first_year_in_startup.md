# My First 18 Months in a Startup

This is a brief story about a few guys who formed a startup. We had no idea what we were doing and in many ways we still don't. It's been about 18 months since I helped co-found Whiz Tutor. In this introductory post, I will briefly describe our progression as a startup and where we are today.

## How I Got Roped In

In October of 2015, I got an email from an old college buddy, Gio. The subject-line read: “Design/Startup Opportunity.” Translation? "Hey JP, I need a favor." I get emails and text messages like this all the time. Here is a snippet of the actual email:

> A couple of colleagues and I are trying to form a startup and we're in need of someone with web/graphic design expertise. I wanted to reach out to familiar faces first before I start interviewing random people. I showed my partners your online portfolio and we really like your work. I can tell you're a whiz at Adobe Creative Studio. [...]

Around the same time as this email, I had just accepted a job offer in LA for a company where I'd be doing pretty ordinary graphic-designer things. That is, I'd be designing their marketing material, some brochures, a couple assets for their website. The usual. At the time, I was completely fine with this. Not ecstatic by any means but a job's a job.

I humored Gio and called him back to hear his pitch on this startup opportunity. To my surprise, I was pretty excited to join the team by the end of the phone call. Here's a breakdown of what he told me:

* They want to create a mobile app equivalent to the "Uber for Tutors"
* They want to start out by designing a prototype of the app to show potential investors
* They have no formal branding or logo, so they'll need that too
* One of other co-founders does some tutoring on the side, so they are going to leverage what he knows
* They have no funding yet nor do they have any revenue coming in but they can offer me some equity

Now I know what you're thinking, "Who in their right mind would be excited about this?!" I was very naive. Mind you, I had no experience with startups nor did I have any idea about how hard it really is to start your own company. I was just excited because they wanted me to design their mobile app from the ground up and they'd give me complete control over that. I had never really been in a position where I had that much creative control over a meaningful project. And this felt like a meaningful project. At the very least, I'd be getting experience in my spare time with something that could potentially advance my career.

## Getting the ball rolling

In retrospect, none of us knew what we were doing. We wanted to create this mobile app but none of us had ANY technical experience and we didn't know anybody who did. I had maybe written a couple lines of HTML back in 2005 when MySpace was still a thing. None of us had any concept of what an API was or why we might need one to build this app. We figured that the pieces will fall into place as soon as we get this protoype fully designed. That was my job.

I want to preface this with a couple things. We had no users or customers at this point. We had done no research about who our potential customers might be. I don't know how many ways I can phrase this; we had zilch, zero, nada. All we had was our very own assumptions about how this app should work. We just started designing based on what we **thought** would be cool and what we **thought** people would love.

The app would work like this:

1. A student opens the app and is presented with a map
2. Tutors who are available for a tutoring session show up on the map as lightbulbs
3. A student can click a lightbulb to book a tutor on-demand

***(some screenshots of our intial wireframes should go here that show the whole map and lightbulb thing)***

If this is confusing, think about how the Uber app works because we basically ripped it off. Typing this out now is really funny because I realize that we were way in over our heads. The way we had planned for this to be designed as so many flaws that I don't even know where to begin. We did have good intentions, however. We really wanted to innovate in this space. We just didn't know what we were doing. Fortunately for us, we didn't have the technological means to bring our baby to life.

## Scrambling to Find Developers

Weeks after going back and forth, our design was as finalized. We were ready to hand off our Uber/Wyzant Frankenstein lovechild off to developers who would turn our dreams into reality. I was ready to be a millionaire. After this app was built, we'd launch our business, quit our day jobs, and swim laps in a pool of money. This is what we thought would happen - or at least I did. Remember how I said I was naive?

What actually happended was we had faced what we thought was our biggest road block. We have this fully designed prototype but it seems impossible to find someone to make it for us. We reached out to all of our college classmates who majored in computer science but making a mobile app wasn't really part of the scope of what they had studied. What is more, the people that we did end up finding that were capable of developing a mobile app were just way too busy to help us out. We didn't want to outsource the project to India and online freelancers were expensive. So we networked.

A few of us attended a hackathon in Santa Clarita back in November of 2016. Our sole purpose was to find people who would be willing to join our team for cheap and help us ship a mobile app. Long story short, we found a guy who would go on to build our backend API and another guy who would build our iOS app. At the time, we were all confused why we needed two people to build one app but we rolled with the punches anyway.

## Expectations vs. Reality

This was the first time that I had collaborated directly with developers and it was exciting. It felt like we were making something cool and meaningful. Over time, we realized that a lot of what we had planned for wasn't realistic to make. There were a lot of changes that had to be made for the sake of development speed. For instance, we realized that this whole map idea would take longer for our developers to execute because they had never implemented something like that before. And the more we thought about it, the more it made sense not to have an on-demand style map anyway. By adding these two developers to a team full of people who didn't know how to code, we all gained a little bit of insight into the development process.

This is really where my personal journey as a developer began. I was so interested in this other half of the "making-an-app" process. Sure, I threw together some designs in Illustrator together and made them clickable by using Invision. But now I really wanted to be able to make these things come to life too. This will be another story for later.


## Getting into a Pre-Accelerator

Fast forward to March of 2016. We're still trying to scrounge together our iOS mobile app. Turns out these things take a long time when you're only developing in your spare time. What did we expect? Our biggest mistake in these 5 months was that we were just sitting on our hands waiting for our mobile app to be complete. Up until this point we still had zero customers and an invalidated market because we weren't going out there and making it happen. We lived off of theory and assumptions. Unbeknownst to me, we were able to raise some capital from friends and family. In an attempt to take our startup to the next level, we applied and got accepted into a Pre-Accelerator program called Startup Next. This was essentially a six week program where we would receive guidance from a wide variety of mentors who had experience with startups, entrepreneurship, marketing, business, development, design, and so on. It was the whole 9 yards.

Let me tell you this, it kicked our ass. We realized just how little we had actually achieved. It's one thing for a group of people to call themselves a startup. It's another thing to actually be a startup. This motivated us to start finding actual tutors and students for our platform. It also turns out that our Rails developer would be able to quickly ship a web app on top of the API that he had already built for our mobile app. Why hadn't we thought of this before?

## Minimum Viable Product

Its's now early May of 2016, a week after finishing the pre-accelerator program. We were equipped with Lean startup methodologies engrained in our heads and a positive attitude that we were heading in the right direction. We had a mobile app that students could use to book tutors and a web app that both tutors and students could use to manager their bookings. We did it. After 8 long months of iterating on our design and software, we were ready for people to start using our app.

We launched and eventually got approval from the App Store. So how come people weren't flocking to our app? Sure, we had a handful of students and tutors that signed up but they weren't even booking sessions. As it turns out, posting a couple Craigslist ads and some flyers on bulletin boards at local colleges for a couple weeks will only get you so far.

## Dog Days of Summer

For the summer months we were very stagnant. The buzz from finishing the pre-accelerator and finally launching finally wore off and it felt like we were going nowhere. We had found another developer to come on board to help us create the Android version of our mobile app and it was at this time that I taught myself how to program. Fall was approaching and we realized that we need to get our shit together for the upcoming semester. We attributed our lack of users to the fact that it was summer and that the need for tutors goes down drastically.

## Finally making it happen

From September 2016 to today we started taking things on the business side more seriously. We focused on marketing and getting traction. What we realized was that if we wanted to make this happen, we'd have to go out there and make it happen ourselves. Instead of waiting for tutors and students to connect organically, we went out looking for students who needed specific tutors and went out to find a tutor who could meet that student's needs. Rinse, wash, repeat. We started talking to students and tutors to get their feedback on what worked well and what didn't work at all. We wanted to discover their pain points when using our apps. After all, we had designed the entire thing with only preconceived notions in mind. **It turns out that most of the time, people don't use an interface the way you expect them to**. Today we have around 500 combined students and tutors on our platform and a decent amount of recurring tutoring sessions a month.

## Looking forward

It took us a year to finally get out feet off the ground and yet there are still a lot of things for us to learn. We did some things wrong but I like to chock that up to lack of experience. Moving forward, there are a few things that I would like us to do more of as a team and things I would like to do more of as an individual.

As a team:

* Apply Lean Startup methodologies when testing features: build, measure, learn
* Focus on traction over technology when it matters

As an individual:

* Talk to our users to gain insight on their behavior and goals
* Design with empathy
* Code more
