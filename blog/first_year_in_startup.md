# My First 18 Months in a Startup

This is a brief story about a few guys who formed a startup. We had no idea what we were doing and in many ways we still don't. It's been about 18 months since I helped co-found Whiz Tutor. In this introductory post, I will briefly describe our progression as a startup and where we are today.

## How I Got Roped In

In October of 2015, I got an email from an old college buddy, Gio. The subject-line read: “Design/Startup Opportunity.” Translation? "Hey JP, I need a favor." I get emails and text messages like this all the time. Here is a snippet of the actual email:

> A couple of colleagues and I are trying to form a startup and we're in need of someone with web/graphic design expertise. I wanted to reach out to familiar faces first before I start interviewing random people. I showed my partners your online portfolio and we really like your work. I can tell you're a whiz at Adobe Creative Studio. [...]

Around the same time as this email, I had just accepted a job offer in LA for a company where I'd be doing pretty ordinary graphic-designer things. That is, I'd be designing their marketing material, some brochures, a couple assets for their website. The usual. At the time, I was content with my situation.

I humored Gio and set up a phone call to hear his pitch. To my surprise, I was excited about joining the team after we had talked. Here's a breakdown of what he told me:

* They want to create a mobile app equivalent to the "Uber for Tutors"
* They want to start out by designing a prototype of the app to show potential investors
* They have no formal branding or logo, so they'll need that too
* One of other co-founders does some tutoring on the side, so they are going to leverage what he knows
* They have no funding yet nor do they have any revenue coming in but they can offer me some equity

Now I know what you're thinking, "Who in their right mind would be excited about this?!" I was very naive. Mind you, I had no experience with startups nor did I have any idea about how hard it really is to start your own company. I was just excited because they wanted me to design their mobile app from the ground up and they'd give me complete control over that. I had never been in a position where I had that much creative control over a meaningful project. And this felt like a meaningful project. At the very least, I'd be getting experience in my spare time with something that could potentially advance my career.

## Getting the ball rolling

In retrospect, none of us knew what we were doing. We wanted to create this mobile app but none of us had ANY technical experience and we didn't know anybody who did. I had maybe written a couple lines of HTML back in 2005 when MySpace was still a thing. None of us had any concept of what an API was or why we might need one to build this app. We figured that the pieces will magically fall into place as soon as we get this protoype fully designed. That was my job.

I want to preface this with a couple things. We had no users or customers at this point. We had done no research about who our potential customers might be. I don't know how many ways I can phrase this; we had zilch, zero, nada. All we had was our very own assumptions about how this app should work and why people are going to love it. We just started designing based on what we **thought** would be cool and what we **thought** would work. (As you might know, this isn't the best way to design good user experiences.)

The app would work like this:

1. A student opens the app and is presented with a map
2. Tutors who are available for an immediate tutoring session show up on the map as lightbulbs
3. A student can tap a lightbulb to book a tutoring session

***(some screenshots of our intial wireframes should go here that show the whole map and lightbulb thing)***

If this is confusing, think about how the Uber app works because we basically ripped it off. I'm currently laughing as I type this because I can see that we were way in over our heads. We did have good intentions, however. We wanted to innovate in this space. We just didn't know what we were doing. Fortunately for us, we didn't have the technological means to bring our baby to life.

## Scrambling to Find Developers

Weeks after going back and forth on how the app should work, our design was as finalized. We were ready to hand off our Uber/Wyzant-Frankenstein-lovechild off to developers who would turn our dreams into reality. I was ready to be a millionaire. After this app was built, we'd launch our business, get VC funding, quit our day jobs, and buy Lamborghinis and bookshelves with all of the money that we'd make. This is what we thought would happen - or at least I did. Did I mention that I was naive?

In reality, our team had just approached our first road block. We have this fully designed prototype but it seems impossible to find someone who can make it for us. We reached out to all of our college classmates who majored in computer science but making a mobile app wasn't really part of the scope of what they had studied. What is more, the people that were capable of developing a mobile app were just way too busy to help us out. We didn't want to outsource the project to India and freelancers were expensive. So we networked.

We attended a hackathon in Santa Clarita in November of 2016. Our sole purpose was to find people who would be willing to join our team for cheap and help us ship a mobile app. Long story short, we found two talented developers who were early in their career and wanted work on a project. Maybe the pieces would fall right into place like we had thought. One developer would create our backend API and the other would create the iOS app to consume said API. At the time, we were all confused why we needed two people to build one app but we rolled with the punches anyway.

## Expectations vs. Reality

This was the first time that I had collaborated directly with developers and it was exciting. Over the course of a couple months, we would work together on the logistics of how the app would work. It felt like we were making something cool and meaningful. And we were. Over time, we realized that a lot of what we had planned for wasn't realistic to make. There were a lot of changes that had to be made for the sake of development speed. For instance, we realized that this whole map idea would take longer for our developers to execute because they had never implemented something like that before. And the more our team thought about it, the more it made sense not to have an on-demand style map anyway. By adding these two developers to a team full of people who didn't know how to code, we all gained a little bit of insight into the development process.

This is where my personal journey as a developer began. I was so interested in this other half of the "making-an-app" process. Sure, I threw together some designs in Illustrator. Sure, I was able to make them 'clickable' by using prototyping software. But now I really wanted to make my creations come to life. I was interested in the inner workings of an application and how the backend and frontend are tied together. There's something satisfying about creating software that other people can use. I think most designers - at some point in their career - have the thought cross their minds that they should learn to code. Before this experience, the thought had crossed my mind too. I just didn't know what I wanted to learn or what I'd do with it. After working hands-on with a few developers, I finally knew why I wanted to code.


## Getting into a Pre-Accelerator

Fast forward to March of 2016. Our API is complete but we're still trying to scrounge together our iOS app. Turns out these things take a long time when you're only developing in your spare time. What did we expect? Our biggest mistake in these 5 months was that we were just sitting on our hands waiting for our developers. Up until this point we still had zero customers and an invalidated market because we weren't going out there and getting customers. We lived off of theory and assumption. Unbeknownst to me, we were able to raise some capital from friends and family. We had to do something to take our startup to the next level. We applied and got accepted into a Pre-Accelerator program called Startup Next. This was a six week program where we would receive guidance from a wide variety of mentors who had experience with startups, entrepreneurship, marketing, business, development, design, and so on. It was the whole 9 yards.

Let me tell you this, it kicked our ass. We realized just how little we had actually achieved. It's one thing for a group of people to call themselves a startup. It's another thing to actually be a startup. This motivated us to start finding actual tutors and students for our platform. If there is one thing that resonated with us at the time, it's that we needed to start putting ourselves out there. We needed to get a product into the hands of our customers and we needed to go out there and get customers. There is a reason that nobody knew who we were and it's because we were aimlessly waiting for magic to happen. As it turns out, our Rails developer would be able to quickly ship a web app on top of the API that he had built. Why hadn't we thought of this before?

## Minimum Viable Product

Its's now early May of 2016, a week after finishing the pre-accelerator program. We were equipped with Lean startup methodologies engrained in our heads and a positive attitude that we were heading in the right direction. We had eventually finished developing our iOS app that students could use to book tutors. From our web app, students and tutors were able to manager their bookings. We did it. After 8 long months of iterating on our design and software, we were ready for people to start using our app.

We "officially" launched and eventually got approval from the App Store. So how come people weren't flocking to our app? Sure, we had a handful of students and tutors that signed up but they weren't even booking sessions. As it turns out, posting a couple Craigslist ads and some flyers on bulletin boards at local colleges for a couple weeks will only get you so far.

## Dog Days of Summer

For the summer months we were very stagnant. The buzz from finishing the pre-accelerator and finally launching wore off and it felt like we were going nowhere. We had found another developer to come on board to help us create the Android version of our mobile app. As an aside, it was during this time that I found time to teach myself how to code. Fall was approaching and we realized that we need to get our shit together for the upcoming semester. We attributed our lack of users and growth to the fact that it was summer and that the need for tutors goes down drastically when school isn't in session.

## Finally making it happen

From September 2016 to today we started taking things on the business side more seriously. We focused on gaining traction. What we realized was that if we wanted to make this happen, we'd have to go out there and make it happen ourselves. Instead of waiting for tutors and students to connect organically, we went out looking for students who needed specific tutors. When we found students who were in need, we went out to find a tutor who could meet those needs. Rinse, wash, repeat. We started talking to students and tutors to get their feedback on what worked well and what didn't work at all. We wanted to discover their pain points when using our apps. After all, we had designed the entire thing entirely based on our own assumptions. **It turns out that most of the time, people don't use an interface the way you expect them to**. Today we have around 500 combined students and tutors on our platform and a decent amount of recurring tutoring sessions a month.

## Looking forward

It took us a year to finally get our feet off the ground and yet there are still a lot of things for us to learn. We did some things wrong but I like to chalk that up to lack of experience. Moving forward, there are a few things that I would like us to do more of as a team and things I would like to do more of as an individual.

As a team:

* Aggressively look to validate or invalidate our assumptions
* Build, measure, learn
* Focus on traction over technology when it matters

As an individual:

* Talk to our users to gain insight on their behavior and goals
* Design with empathy
* Code more
