# My First 18 Months in a Startup

This is story about a few guys who formed a startup. We had no idea what we were doing and in many ways we still don't. It's been about 18 months since I helped co-found Whiz Tutor. In that time I've learned a few things and picked up a few skills.

## How I Got Roped In

In October of 2015, I got an email from an old college buddy, Gio. The subject-line read: “Design/Startup Opportunity.” Translation? "Hey JP, I need a favor." I get emails and text messages like this all the time. Here is a snippet of the actual email:

> A couple of colleagues and I are trying to form a startup and we're in need of someone with web/graphic design expertise. I wanted to reach out to familiar faces first before I start interviewing random people. I showed my partners your online portfolio and we really like your work. I can tell you're a whiz at Adobe Creative Studio. [...]

Around the same time as this email, I had just accepted a job offer in LA for a company where I'd be doing pretty ordinary graphic-designer things. That is, I'd be designing their marketing material, some brochures, a couple assets for their website. The usual. At the time, I was completely fine with this. Not ecstatic by any means but a job's a job.

I humored Gio and called him back to hear his pitch on this startup opportunity. To my surprise, I was pretty excited to join the team by the end of the phone call. Here's a breakdown of what he told me:

* They want to create a mobile app equivalent to the "Uber for Tutors"
* They want to start out by designing a prototype of the app to show potential investors
* They have no formal branding or logo, so they'll need that too
* One of other co-founders does some tutoring on the side, so they are going to leverage what he knows
* They have no funding yet nor do they have any revenue coming in but they can offer me some equity

Now I know what you're thinking, "Who in their right mind would be excited about this?!" I was very naive. Mind you, I had no experience with startups nor did I have any idea about how hard it really is to start your own company. I was just excited because they wanted me to design their mobile app from the ground up and they'd give me complete control over that. I had never really been in a position where I had that much creative control over a meaningful project. And this felt like a meaningful project. At the very least, I'd be getting experience in my spare time with something that could potentially advance my career.

## Getting the ball rolling

In retrospect, none of us knew what we were doing. We wanted to create this mobile app but none of us had ANY technical experience and we didn't know anybody who did. I had maybe written a couple lines of HTML back in 2005 when MySpace was still a thing. None of us had any concept of what an API was or why we might need one to build this app. We figured that the pieces will fall into place as soon as we get this protoype fully designed. That was my job.

Let me be clear, this isn't a process that I would suggest following by any means. We had no users or customers at this point. We had done no research about who our potential customers might be. I don't know how many ways I can phrase this; we had zilch, zero, nada. All we had was our very own assumptions about how this app should work. We just started designing based on what we **thought** would be cool and what we **thought** people would love.

The app would work like this:


1. Click on a tutor (represented by a lightbulb) on a map
2. Schedule appointment for tutor
3. ???
4. Get good grades

***(some screenshots of our intial wireframes should go here that show the whole map and lightbulb thing)***

Yeah, we ripped off Uber. We didn't even consider that the map would be empty to start off because we had no tutors. I mean, what kind of user experience is that for the student? They would log into the app only to see an empty map with no tutors. Now what? Fortunately for us, we didn't have the technological means to bring our baby to life.

## Scrambling to Find Developers

Weeks after going back and forth, we had designed a prototype on Invision and even established some branding. Now we had to find someone who could actually bring this thing to life.
