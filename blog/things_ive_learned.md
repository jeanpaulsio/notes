Things I've learned:

* Not everything needs to be an app
* Coincidentally, there's an app for everything
* Never assume that people will know how to navigate an interface that you design
* I'm not always right but I'm right sometimes and that counts for something

Skills I've picked up:

* How to code stuff
* How to design stuff better
