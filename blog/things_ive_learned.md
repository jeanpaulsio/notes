Things I've learned:

* Not everything needs to be an app
* Coincidentally, there's an app for everything
* Never assume that people will know how to navigate an interface that you design
* I'm not always right but I'm right sometimes and that counts for something

Skills I've picked up:

* How to code stuff
* How to design stuff better


The things I've listed under the skills that I've picked up are intentionally oversimplified because I think they deserve their own attention in a separate post. While I won't go into the details of these two lists in this story now, I do eventually intend on doing so. I digress. Our business is simple. You schedule a tutor online using our webapp and meet them in person. Easy. Anyway, this is a story about the last 18 months
