* VAS - Visual Analog Scale
* SF-36.pdf - probably the most complicated

Goals
* Doctors to understand their patients better

> With my treatment, your ODI score will decrease, etc

* Easier access of data from a research perspective
* pull up every patient who you've ever had and sort based on parameters

* basically active record for doctors
* give doctors a language so they dont have to write SQL queries

# Models



Patient
* Baseline Surveys
* You'd do multiple ODIs - before - after - after a few weeks etc
* name, age, sex, surgery (typeof) - but they don't always go in for surgery
* pre-op patient vs. post-op patient
  - they fill out different forms based on pre/post
* 


---

Give doctors the legos (forms) - they should be able to customize which forms they give for pre/post

* front desk will know what forms to administrate based on doctors preferences

"i hate giving doctors SF36s, don't include that"

3 Sides:

1. front desk: registers patient, access scores, pull up preop/post op files. they administer forms; collect forms

2. Patient side - they only see the forms

3. Clinician side - categorizing data by however they want - stratify the patients based on the surgery they had; manipulate data as well - they should be able to enter the type of surgery a patient had

This side needs to happen through a web app

The other two sides happen through an ipad

* Admin side for preferences
* Admin query
* User fills out survey

---

patients can also be in a non-op category

whats non-op? no surgery

then you convert the patient to an op-patient

Users

* Administrators (doctors) - login
