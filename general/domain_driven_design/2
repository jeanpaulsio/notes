# Chapter 3 - Binding Model and Implementation

* Begins with an anecdote about an intricate model that the developers saw and ended up not using at all!
* Important that the connection doesn't break down between model and software

"What good is a model on paper unless it directly aids the development of running software?"

"If the design, or some central part of it, does not map to the domain model, that model is of little value, and the correctness of the software is suspect"

"Demand a single model that serves both purposes well, in addition to supporting a robust ubiquitous language"
