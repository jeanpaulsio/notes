# Chapter 1 - Crunching Knowledge

What happens when your software isn't domain-driven?

__waterfall method__

business experts talk to analysts - who abstract and pass the result to the programmers - who then reate the software. This approach lacks feedback. anaylsts are the ones with the power to create the model


__iterative process__

sometimes projects take on an iterative process but fail to build up knowledge. devs get the experts to describe a feature, then they go build it. they show the experts the result and then ask what to do next.

if devs aren't interested in the domain, they only learn what the __application should do__, not the principles behind it. useful software can be built this way but this software will never get to a point where it can roll out powerful features


## Continuous Learning

Domains that seem less technically daunting can be deceiving: we don't realize how much we don't know. This ignorance leads us to make false assumptions.
