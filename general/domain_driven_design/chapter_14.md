# Part 4 - Strategic Design

* need techniques for manipulating and comprehending large models
* how do we scale complicated domains?
* system must be broken into smaller parts

3 Themes:
1. Context - domain must be consistent w/ no overlapping definitions in subsystems
2. Distillation - focus attention on the core and presenting other elements in their supporting roles
3. Large scale structure

> Large-scale structure brings consistency to disparate parts to help those parts mesh. Structure and distillation make the complex relationships between parts comprehensible while keeping the big picture in view. Bounded contexts allow work to proceed in different parts without corrupting the model or unintentionally fragmenting it. Adding these concepts to the team's UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE helps developers work out their solutions

What does this all mean??????

Chapter 14 talks about __bounded contexts__

# Chapter 14 - Maintaining Model Integrity

Welcome to Iteration: a weekly podcast about development and design through the lens of amazing books, chapter-by-chapter

Intro

Today we will be kicking off the final section - Part 4: Strategic Design. This section is all about scale and the problems that come with large domains. Evans gives us three helpful themes that allow developers to wrangle this problem. This chapter touches on the first theme: context.
