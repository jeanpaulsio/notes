# Chapter 2 - Communication and the use of language

> A domain model can be the core of a common language for a software project. The model is a set of concepts built up in the heads of people on the project, with terms and relationships that reflect domain insight

* There is a linguistic divide. Domain experts use their own jargon. Developers use their own jargon
* Words and meanings can get abstracted through communication.
* It's kind of like playing telephone - the original meaning might get lost in translation

> A project needs a common language that is more robust than the lowest common denominator

* An example of this - pointing to Whiz Tutor - the idea of coupons vs. referals
* A sort of back and forth is required to find common language. Then, as a developer, you can go back and update class diagrams and rename classes and methods in the code - or even change the behavior
