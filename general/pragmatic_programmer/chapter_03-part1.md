# Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools

> Every craftsman starts his or her journey with a basic set of good quality tools

Discussion: What are your tools?

> Tools become conduits from the craftsman's brain to the finished product - they have become extensions of his or her hands

> Always be on the lookout for better ways of doing things

## Tip 20: Keep Knowledge in plain text

JP: plain text doesn't become obsolete - as opposed to binary. this seems obvious.  this is mostly about readability

## Tip 21: Use the power of command shells

JP: you can do everything in the shell that you do using the GUI: launch apps, browsers; search files; `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm -rf`. basically i need to get better at this. `touch newfile.rb` is faster than `right click > new file > newfile.rb > carriage return`

## Tip 22: use a single editor well

JP: fuck IDE's, VIM all the way, baby!!! I no longer rely on auto complete and it's amazing. The editor is an extension to your hand

## Tip 23: Always use source code control

JP: the front end devs at my job don't check their files into git and it blows my mind.

## Tip 24: Fix the problem, not the blame

JP: "it doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's. it is still your problem". suck it up!

## Tip 25: Don't panic when debugging

JP: don't waste energy denying that a bug is possible. clearly, it is. just breathe

**Picks**

JP: git course on front end masters
