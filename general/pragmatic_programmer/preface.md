> This book will help you become a better programmer

* this book was written in freaking 1999! I was 7.

* programming is a craft
* "as a programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator. you try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. you try to document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the relentless ticking of the project clock. you work small miracle every day"
* "you shouldn't be weldeded to any particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations"

__What makes a pragmatic programmer__

1. early adopter / fast adapter
2. inquisitive - you ask questions
3. critical thinker
4. realistic
5. jack of all trades

__Tips__

Tip 1: Care about your craft
Tip 2: Think about your work - never run on auto pilot

"great lawns need small amounts of dialy care, and so do great programmers."

* kaizen - continuous small improvements

Tip 3: Provide Options, Don't make lame excuses

* basically, take responsibility
* when something can't be done, explain what can be done to salvage the situation

__Challenge__

* How do you react when someone - such as a bank teller, a mechanic, or a clerk - comes to you with a lame excuse. What do you think of them and their company as a result?

hmmmmm.... really gets you thinking

Software entropy - aka Broken window theory - aka software rot

This is a great metaphor:

> One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment - ... so another window gets broken. People start littering. graffiti appears. 

* police in NY and other major cities have cracked (no put intended) down on small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff. 

Tip 4: don't leave broken windows

* systems rot quickly with one broken window. wow. this cuts me deep. haha.
* don't let entropy win!!!
* in the opposite case, where there are no broken windows - and its extremely pristine - you don't want to be THAT guy that makes a mess.
