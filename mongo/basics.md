# Mongo
* a _collection_ is the core unit of what stores data in a Mongo DB
* we typically have one collection for each type of resource we want to make available in our app
* we don't mix any type of data in our collections

```
Collection: States
-california
-texas
-florida

Collection: Books
-book 1
-book 2
-book 3
```

* think about collections when coming up with your database schema
