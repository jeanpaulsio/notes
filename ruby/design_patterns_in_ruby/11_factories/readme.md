# Picking the Right Class with a Factory

We'll look at both the **Factory Method pattern** and the **Abstract Factory pattern**

## A Different Kind of Duck Typing

* We'll start by programming a simulation of a pond with ducks.
* We'll have a `Duck` class and a `Pond` class to contain them
* The ducks will be able to eat, sleep, and make noise

*see `1_ducks.rb`*

* Here we are simulating 1 day with 3 ducks in our pond
* But what happens when we want to introduce `frogs` to our pond?

*see `2_ducks_and_frogs.rb`*
