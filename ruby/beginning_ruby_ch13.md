* Rails is made up of several different libraries
* _Action Mailer_ - library makes it easy to send emails from Rails applications
* _Action Pack_ - library provides methods used in views and controllers to generate HTML and dynamic page elements like AJAX
* _Active Record_ - an object-relational mapper that ties database tables to classes
* _Active Support_ - library that collects a number of support and utility classes used by various Rails features. For example, this library provides methods that help you manipulate time, numbers, arrays, hashes, etc
* _Active Job_ - framework defines tasks that can take place independently of usual request and response cycle
