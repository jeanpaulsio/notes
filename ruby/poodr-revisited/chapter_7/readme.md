Honor the contract

Subclasses agree to a contract; they promise to be substitutable for their superclasses. Substitutability is possible only when objects behave as expected and subclasses are expected to conform to their superclasses' interface. They must respond to every message in that interface, taking the same kinds of inputs and returning the same kinds of outputs.

Subclasses __should be a substitute for their superclass__

Template method pattern

Template methods represent parts of the algorithm that vary and creating them forces you to make explicit decisions about what varies and what does not
