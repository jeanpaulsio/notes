# Chapter 1 - Object-Oriented Design

* the world is procedural
* the world is also object oriented
* view the world __as a series of spontaneous interactions between objects__

> OO Design requires that you shift from thinking of the world as a collection of predefined procedures to modeling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects.

* OO apps are made up of parts that interact to produce behavior of the whole
* the "parts" are objects; interactions are embodied in the *messages* that pass between them
* getting the right message to the correct target requires that the sender of the message know things about the receiver
* this "knowledge" creates dependencies between the two
